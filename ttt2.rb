# 1. Come up with requirements/ specifications, which will determine the scope.

# 3. Translation of those steps into code - focus on a layer at a time
# 4. Run code to verify logic

# Pseudo code
# Create a 3x3 grid

# Assign Player to "X"
# Assign Computer to "O"

# loop until a winner or all squares are taken
#   Player chooses an empty space in 3x3 grid
#   CHECK for winner
#   Computer chooses an empty space in 3x3 grid
#   CHECK for winner
# end

# if there's a winner
#   show the winner
# or else
#   it's a tie

# 3 in a row, in a column, or diagonally left or diagonally right wins
# Tie if all spaces filled but neither player wins
